### Part 1:
If you'd change *$matrix* to any other type except array - the error will be displayed. If you'll try to pass not an array in *getMatrixElement()* method - the error will be displayed too. **Pros** of using this is that you'll get error before next part of code will be executed, the code is easily readable. **Cons** is that more strict rules is for writing the code.
### Part 2:
We can change *$string* to f.e. *123456* and the code executes without errors, it converts integer to string and reverses to *654321* with *stringReverse()* method. Even if you pass boolean(true) - it converts it to 1 and the code works. **Pros** is that code WORKS with most types of variables with no errors. **Cons** is that it's hard to decide what type of variable to use, as code can work without any errors and in the next part of code you can get fatal errors. It could be harder to debug.
